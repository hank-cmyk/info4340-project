# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a _living_ document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. Team name or project name.

   Gray Guava

2. To what goals do we all commit?

   - learning, understanding and applying class material
   - working together
   - holding each other accountable
   - trying our best
   - submitting milestones on time
   - at the end of the project, we expect to have designed and implemented a high quality prototype that we are all satisfied with
   - having fun

3. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

   - no idea is a bad idea, listen to ideas
   - be respectful and supportive
   - communicate openly and actively
   - tell other group members in advance if you cannot finish your part honestly, and we will figure a way out

4. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

   - we will communicate on GroupMe, and Zoom if necessary
   - we will communicate on GroupMe as needed, and for each milestone we will meet at least twice a week

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

   - meeting organizer: this role will be responsible for sending out Zoom links if needed, and finding best times to meet that works for everyone
   - note taker: this role will be responsible for taking notes if we have meetings
   - reminder: this role will be responsible for making sure we are on track for due dates, and sending out reminders to other members if necessary
   - proofreader: this role will be responsible for double checking each submission after we all do the same.

6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

   - we will message each other on GroupMe to hold one another accountable
   - one person can privately message them and make sure that they are okay and are up to doing the work on time
   - we would meet with a team member who failed to deliver what was promised, and form a strategy to ensure that this situation won't arise again

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict do we all agree to uphold?

   - we will have a team meeting where we share each of our thoughts and try to resolve any friction
   - we will try to resolve any disagreements before they evolve
   - we all agree to uphold a peaceful approach to conflict

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

   - if someone wanted to change the contract, we would talk about it (physically or virtually) and then come to a consensus before updating the contract

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a _fun_ clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

   - we congratulate each other after submission due dates
   - we provide positive encouragement
   - we all send a happy emoji in chat after submission due dates
