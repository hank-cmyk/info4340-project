- project themes 

## Users

- **Final: Our users are college students who cook on a consistent basis and want a more efficient cooking process.**

- v1: Our users are college students who enjoy cooking and/or would like to "find recipes"
  (most likely will change after user interviews/research)

## User Research

### Methods & Justifications

- We conducted 7 semi-structured interviews with our interviewees. 
- We think semi-structured interview was the best way to gather data from users because in field studies, they may have felt more pressure completing everyday cooking tasks under our gazes. We also wanted to gather data from non-Cornell students, and as such, field studies wouldn't have been possible. 

### Interview Questions

General question: Tell me about your entire cooking process, from choosing what you want to eat, go grocery shopping, to the end of the cooking process/from beginning to the end.

1. How do you describe your cooking skill? (novice, intermediate, or expert)

2. In a week, how many meals/how often do you cook?

   - Are you cooking for yourself or for others as well?

3. What obstacles do you face when cooking?

4. What do you think could help you make the cooking process better/easier?

5. What kinds of ingredients do you most often cook with?

6. Do you look for recipes before cooking?

   - If so, how?
   - Why?

7. Can you recall a time when you looked up a recipe? Tell me about it.

8. Do you have a collection of recipes?
   - If so, how do you store them/organize them?

In addition to this, we will also ask any other questions, follow-up or otherwise, that come up during our interviews

### Interview Notes with Brief Summaries

- All interview notes in interview-notes.md.

### Affinity Diagram / Card-sorting

Below is our initial card-sort, where we decided to group our interview notes based on the questions that
were asked.

First card-sort:

- ![First card sort image 1](images/cs1A.png)
- ![First card sort image 2](images/cs1B.png)
- ![First card sort image 3](images/cs1C.png)
- ![First card sort image 4](images/cs1D.png)
- ![First card sort image 5](images/cs1E.png)
- ![First card sort image 6](images/cs1F.png)
- ![First card sort image 7](images/cs1G.png)

Below is our second card-sort, where we sorted based on what the interview notes had in common, such as common ways that users looked at recipes, rather than separating them by interview question.

Second card-sort:

- ![Second card sort image 1](images/cs2A.png)
- ![Second card sort image 2](images/cs2B.png)
- ![Second card sort image 3](images/cs2C.png)
- ![Second card sort image 4](images/cs2D.png)
- ![Second card sort image 5](images/cs2E.png)
- ![Second card sort image 6](images/cs2F.png)
- ![Second card sort image 7](images/cs2G.png)
- ![Second card sort image 8](images/cs2H.png)
- ![Second card sort image 9](images/cs2i.png)
- ![Second card sort image 10](images/cs2J.png)
- ![Second card sort image 11](images/cs2K.png)
- ![Second card sort image 12](images/cs2L.png)

Below is our third and final card-sort, where we realized that some of the small groups had common content among them, so we grouped them under larger labels that would better showcase the user's thoughts and needs.

- ![Third card sort image 1](images/cs3A.png)
- ![Third card sort image 2](images/cs3B.png)
- ![Third card sort image 3](images/cs3C.png)
- ![Third card sort image 4](images/cs3D.png)
- ![Third card sort image 5](images/cs3E.png)
- ![Third card sort image 6](images/cs3F.png)
- ![Third card sort image 7](images/cs3G.png)
- ![Third card sort image 8](images/cs3H.png)
- ![Third card sort image 9](images/cs3i.png)

### Executive Summary - Key Points of users' goals

- Users want instructions that are easy to follow, clear, and also step-by-step
- Users want to store recipes in convenient and easy to access ways
- Users want to look up recipes without too much effort, and find recipes that are based on reasons such as cravings, ingredients they have, or techniques
- User want to stay organized and tidy throughout the cooking process

## All Problems Identified

- Users have trouble following recipes that are too complicated, or don't have step-by-step or clear instructions
- Users keep making the same kinds of meals with the same ingredients, and sometimes are not satisfied with the limited variety
- Users have trouble gathering all ingredients, or having all the ingredients
- Users have trouble staying organized throughout the cooking process
- Users have trouble with the timing of some steps in recipes
- Users don't always have the right tools necessary to cook the recipe (utensils, pots, etc.)
- Users don't know when to need special equipment, like protective eyewear
- Users have too many people in the house and/or too small of a kitchen
- Users go back and forth when looking at recipes 
- Users don't always store recipes, don't find them again

## Key Problems

1. Users have trouble following recipes that are too complicated, or don't have step-by-step or clear instructions
2. Users keep making the same kinds of meals with the same ingredients, and sometimes are not satisfied with the limited variety 

## Value Propositions

- This app enables a more organized, clear way for users to find and follow recipes step-by-step, from the ingredient gathering process to plating
- The app enables complicated recipes to be broken down into simple, timeable steps
- The app suggests new recipes based upon the usersâ€™ favorite recipes

## Scenarios

- Jon is an Information Science student who is planning to make dinner after his last class of the day, which ends at around 5:00pm. He knows that he has tomatoes in his kitchen, and he'd like to make an interesting yet simple meal with them before they spoil, but he doesn't know what he will make yet. Jon does know, however, that he wants to make it under an hour, as he has a lot of homework. When he goes onto the app, he searches up "tomato" so that he could find a recipe, and finds one for soup that would take ~30min. He follows this tomato soup recipe through to the finish. 
- Audrey is a Math student with limited cooking skills, and is planning to hold a barbecue this weekend for her friends, as a celebration for finishing their prelims. She wants to make sure she has enough time to start cooking on Saturday morning, so that she is ready for the evening gathering. Through the app, Audrey looks at the time it will take to cook cheese burgers, a recipe that she knows her friends love, and finds out how long it till take so she knows exactly when to start cooking. 
- Isabel is an English student, and she loves to cook dinner for herself and her roommates after class. She usually likes to cook grilled cheeses, because cheese is her favorite ingredient to cook with, and it's also comforting, warm, and filling for her and her roommates. However, Isabel and her roommates have gotten kind of tired of all the grilled cheese, so they are looking for a new recipe that still includes cheese in some capacity, and will still be filling and comforting. When opening the app, Isabel sees that theres a recipe that is suggested for her. She thinks this is perfect, because it still includes cheese, and will also be filling and enjoyed by everyone.

## Persona

Gary is a senior studying Computer Science at Cornell. He loves taking walks around between classes and whenever he has free time, and finds himself eating lunches at Mattin's a lot, both because it's very convenient as an engineer, but also because he likes the food options there and knows that he'll find whatever he orders delicious. He lives in Collegetown by himself, and he enjoys cooking himself meals at least once a day. He doesn't always have enough time to go grocery shopping due to his high workload, so he ends up ordering the same ingredients many times and making the same meals. Because he is reading code all day, he doesn't enjoy reading large amounts of text, especially after days with many classes. 

## Project Themes

- Mobile app - The app will be designed for mobile use, as this is convenient and accessible for users. This will also allow us to focus on a more vertical (mobile) design, and work with the smaller space. 
- Concise, less text - The app will have a larger focus on concise text, and also include images. Recipes will be displayed with images next to a simple title and the time needed for making the recipe, and the instructions for the recipes themselves will be split up into separate screens, to deter from very long and sometimes overwhelming blocks of text in a row. 
- Timeable step-by-step instructions - Each step for the recipe will include a feature for a timer, which would be counting down as the user completes the step. This will help them to manage their time better, and to alleviate any pressure from timing, the timer will also include a pause button, a play button, and a refresh timer button. 
- Smart suggestions - The app will include recipe suggestions based on the recipes that the user has favorited. This will allow them to get more variety in what they make, while also being tailored towards them. This will likely not be fully developed and coded as part of the final prototype.
