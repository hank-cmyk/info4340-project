1. In a week, how many meals/how often do you cook?

   - Are you cooking for yourself or for others as well?

   - had trouble thinking at first, trying to think
   - the logical answer would be 3 meals per day, and then times by the days of the week
   - does not eat 3 meals a day
   - cooks everyday at least once or twice
   - twice a day, probably
   - 14 times a week, maybe 15 or 16
   - sometimes she does all the cooking

   - cooking for yourself and others, it is a mix

2. What do you think could help you make the cooking process better/easier?

   - preparing things overnight

   - sometimes, it's not having ingredients
   - small kitchen
   - kitchen stuff, having certain kitchen stuff to cook in general
     - kitchen tools
     - don't really need many tools but it would be nice, it would help

5. Do you look for recipes before cooking?

   - if so, how?
     - yes: Google
     - What do you google?
       - made mac and cheese
       - had a craving - so googles that
       - "easy \_\_\_\_" - craving for that day, or what you want to make
       - things with sauces
   - Why?
     - because she doesn't know how to cook
     - cook for 2 sometimes, it's good to try new things
     - makes something - but sometimes it's likes "it needs this" or "I forgot this"
       - so she will search up for something, and try that instead
       - usually when trying to cook something for the first time, often missing something
       - would look up a recipe for the next time she would try making it

6. Can you recall a time when you looked up a recipe?

   - for a chicken alfredo, for the pasta alfredo sauce
   - finds it so easy to make, she didn't know that
   - "easy alfredo sauce"
   - had the ingredients : milk, butter, garlic, flour, etc
   - didn't know she could add oregano
   - so easy, just get garlic, butter, put in a pan
   - wait until it clumps up
   - add milk, then a little flour
   - didn't know she was supposed to add flour to pasta before
   - then, add the sauce
   - add oregano, she was surprised
   - but it was good
   - when done with the recipe, it felt like it needed something

     - sometimes when following a easy recipe, it can be too easy, a little bland

   - if kept making more and more alfredo, would eventually just combine them
   - take the knowledge, and put it towards next time, maybe add a little twist

   - she bookmarks them sometimes, but rarely - on computer

8. (if they said they use recipes) How do you look at recipes while cooking?
   - pulls it up on her phone
   - doesn't really follow it sometimes
   - it depends how she's feeling: "2 cups of \_\_\_, 1 tbsp of this"
     - might be like "that's good enough"
     - eyeballs things sometimes

### Summary

From this interview, I learned that she thought that a way to meal prep in some way would be really useful, because she seems to cook quite often during the week. When she searches up recipes, she often puts "easy" in front of it, to look for simpler recipes, and she looks up recipes based on what she is craving. She enjoys using recipes when she wants clarification on little things to add here and there, and she might also add in her own twists because when she is using an "easy" recipe, she finds that they are often a little off, or a little bland.

   - usually cooks for themself first
   - sometimes cooks for a parent
   - sometimes needed to cook for sister

2. What do you think could help you make the cooking process better/easier?

   - keeping everything organized and clean/tidy
   - there's so much time spent, and so much motivation lost after cooking
     - usually clean as they go, an by like halfway through, they are just exhausted
     - don't want to clean up at the end, just like the last pots/bowls used

   - onions

   - they often have these ingredients at home already
   - because they cook with them the most often
   - staples

5. Do you look for recipes before cooking?

   - if so, how?

     - sometimes
     - if they are just making 'this' or 'that': such as chopped vegetables, then no
       - they just do it, and stir fry, for example
     - but mostly, they will
     - makes them come up with something new
     - often adds their own twist to things, because their tastes are quite different
     - if they are making a certain dish, they will search up a recipe
     - if they are making something like bits and pieces of other things, then they will not look up
     - search them up on the internet
       - \_\_\_\_ recipe
       - looks at the ingredients and the techniques used
       - intrigued by seeing they used a rice cooker, and used chicken broth
       - if something really sticks out, they will usually refer to it and try it
       - looks up recipes based on what they are craving
       - "easy cheese recipes/dishes" - and then they find something like a mac and cheese recipe

   - Why?
     - just to make sure they get proportions right
     - if there is something key they need
     - for example: butter chicken: they need to make sure they get the consistency of the cream right, and to not overcook chicken, etc.
     - helpful to look at recipe for tips
       - a little bit of both: they will look for techniques and also what to add
       - some techniques just easy to understand if you've cooked before
       - but for some occasions: such as rice pudding: make sure that the milk is boiled, but you can't look away from the milk that's boiling, so it's helpful to look at recipes and see how long the milk is on for
       - managing time

6. Can you recall a time when you looked up a recipe?

   - they had trouble remembering at first
   - they remember a long time ago, 5 years ago, they saw a good mac and cheese recipe, and it was made in a rice cooker
   - they were intrigued
   - they followed most of the recipe, but some of the cheeses they didn't have, so they had to work their way around it
   - it was good, they found it delicious
   - was actually very easy, just a little trouble with the ingredients
   - have not made it again since, but they would like to
   - bookmarked on laptop!

7. Do you have a collection of recipes?

   - if so, how do you store them/organize them?

   - they save it in a Discord server
   - created this because they kept sending links to their friend, and they kept pinning it, but they ran out of space in the pins so they decided that it would be easier to just put them in a channel
   - can easily search them up
   - they like that it's because they're always on this server
   - very convenient
   - can search for it by name
   - sometimes don't remember the name itself, but there's a lot of descriptive words, so they can kind of remember the name, but also search it up easily
   - can share the recipes with their friends
   - having phone access is also useful if they want to make something with friends (at friend's house)

8. (if they said they use recipes) How do you look at recipes while cooking?
   - look at their laptop, their phone sometimes
   - but usually laptop
   - the screen is bigger, can look at it from far away

### Summary

From this interview I learned that they find organization while cooking to be a problem, and that they also find that trying to clean/tidy as they cook can get tiring, especially if they finish cooking and there's still a few things left to clean. They usually look at a recipe to make sure of any key ingredients of techniques (consistencies, cooking times), and they like to store them in a Discord channel because it is convenient, easy to search for specific recipes, and accessible.

### Summary

From this interview, I learned that she often finds herself going back and forth many, many times between what she's cooking and the recipe, and also that she cooks with the same ingredients a lot, and uses recipes to try and find varieties of ways to cook them. She does not store the recipes she likes in anyways, but would like to use NYT Cooking, a service that would allow her to: easily look up recipes and input the ingredients she has, know the specific measurements for the number of people she is cooking for, and get inspiration from the popular recipes of the week.

### Summary:

I learned that getting all the ingredients is a problem, sometimes because they are not available at local stores, and sometimes because user fails to track the freshness of the ingredients.

This user also cares about food quality and hopes to get clear instruction of cooking techniques (like the amount of water).

### Summary

From this interview, I learned that the user only searches for recipes if she wants to make a new food for the first time or she becomes stuck in the process of making a particular food. Specifically, I learned that the user prefers to look for recipes that are easy to follow, feasible, and tend to fit her expectations (e.g. if she expects to utilize certain ingredients such as cooking alcohol). Otherwise, if it is not the user's first time making a food, the user immediately dives into the cooking process. In addition, the user usually finds a recipes she likes by performing a basic Google search; however, she typically does not bookmark the recipe page. As a result, the user does not have a collection of recipes.

### Summary

From this interview I learned that the participant has trouble finding the time and motivation to try new recipes.
This may be due to the lack of an effective method to organize his exisiting recipes. I also learned that this participant
sticks with tried and true recipes due to his laziness of getting ingredients; by maintaining a short list of things to buy each week,
he saves time. However, this results in a monotounous dish rotation that they are not particularly satisifed with.
