# Milestone 4 

### Summary

- Project Group: Gray Guava 
- Team Members: Hanna Kang (hak63), Yulu Cao (yc758), Simrin Kapoor (sk2422), and Jason Zheng (jz449)
- Project Choice: Recipe Finder
- Target users: college students who cook on a fairly consistent basis and would like a more efficient cooking process.
- Key problems: 
    1. Users have trouble following recipes that are too complicated, or don't have step-by-step or clear instructions
    2. Users keep making the same kinds of meals with the same ingredients, and sometimes are not satisfied with the limited variety 

This page includes all of the planning we tried to think of before coding the actual prototype. This also includes how we would try to break up the feature branches so we could all work on different parts.

## Planning
Below is some of the planning we did for the app's organization and modularity. It includes the views we think we may need, as well as the components and also the start of planning for JSON mock data.
