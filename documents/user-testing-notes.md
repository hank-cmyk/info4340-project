## User H1

### Basic Information

- Personal Background: She is a senior at Cornell studying Computer Science. She lives in Collegetown in an apartment with several roommates, and she goes to Wegman's often for grocery shopping, usually in the morning. She is originally from Long Island, New York.
  - she/her

### Notes

1.

- she started on the home screen
- went to the search page via the search icon, after she clicked on the favorites page - she said she was just looking around
- she typed "tomato" and pressed enter on keyboard
  - didn't work, so she pressed search button
- said she'd want to make spaghetti, personally
- but clicked on tomato soup recipe because "longer than half an hour"
- checked through the ingredients, said what she had out loud
  - said she didn't have flour
  - didn't check flour box
  - asked if she'd still be able to make the recipe
- went to next page - recipe step 1
- skimmed through instructions very fast, she said she just read it through fast
- went to timer and clicked play, it didn't work yet
  - (i said what it was supposed to do)
- went to next page, she didn't read this one fully
- pressed to next page very fast
- like she skipped this screen almost
- finish page
- pressed big green finish button
- asked what the next button would lead to, and tried to go back
  - she had to go back through the whole recipe to go back to final screen
  - said she thought the next button might have led to something else, not sure what

2.

- started on home screen
- said if she were going to bbq, would probably bring mac and cheese anyways
- recipe length wasn't that long
  - she went to search page after she noted the recipe time wasn't long
- search screen, she scrolled down and didn't type
- she said she was about to click on grilled cheese but wasn't a long time
  - she said the times out loud (grilled cheese 15 min)
  - she would click on this because "grilled"
- found cheese burger and said it would take 2 hour 25 min

3.

- started on home screen
- she said she loved cheese
- said the home screen already had a cheese recipe
- she said mac and cheese would be good for her and the roommates in this situation
  - said "oh, it's suggested"
- she favorited the mac and cheese
  - then went to favorites page on nav bar
  - said she wanted to see it there, almost forgot
  - found the two recipes with "cheese"
  - noted she would probably make the mac and cheese

### Summary

Overall, she was able to complete all of the user testing really easily, even though some took longer than I thought she would. She said that she wished the timer was playable, which we are working on currently. Also, there were some parts we could improve with: the final recipe screen had a lot of different buttons, and when she wanted to go back to the final screen, she had to go through all of the screens again - so maybe a way to just go back to the last screen accessed would be useful. Also, she seemed to be satisfied with the "mac and cheese" on the home page, and even said that she "almost forgot" to check the favorites page, so maybe we could emphasize it more.



## User H2

### Basic Information

- Personal Background: He is a senior at Johns Hopkins University, and is studying public health. He lives in an apartment with roommates, and they order food or go out to eat a lot, only cooking smaller meals for himself. He likes to play video games.
  - he/him

### Notes

1.

- he started on home screen
- went to search icon on bottom
- said he could see the "tomato soup" right there, "what is the point of the search bar"
  - (i said "in a non-prototype, there would be many, many recipes)
- pressed on the tomato soup
- checked through ingredients, said he didn't have salt
  - went to home page after saying that
  - then went back to recipe - he said "i'll just do it anyways"
- step one soup - he read through the instruction
- pressed the play on timer
  - (i explained how it was supposed to work)
  - nodded
- went to next step, and read instruction
- didn't try timer again
- last slide recipe
  - he asked why there were only two steps
- pressed green finish button - return home

2.

- started on home screen
- he went to search screen
- typed in "barbecue", no search results
- asked what he was supposed to be looking for
- he typed in "bbq" and nothing happened
  - "there's no recipes for bbq"
- went back to the search page (without anything searched)
  - just looked through all the recipes on the search page
  - found cheese burger
  - said it would take 2hour 25 minute

3.

- he started on home screen
- said he located the cheese recipe - mac and cheese
- on home screen
- he favorited it
- went to favorites page afterwards
- found two cheese recipes, still chose mac and cheese recipe

### Summary

Overall, I think that he did a pretty good job at following the user testing scenarios, and there were some issues that arose. Firstly, with the second task, he typed in "bbq" and "barbecue" and wasn't able to find anything, so instead he opted to manually go through and find the cheese burger recipe. Maybe we could include some kind of additional filters for events and meals, so that users wouldn't have to manually go through. Also, he asked what the point of the search bar, and even though in a non-prototype app there would be many recipes so the search bar would be really important, maybe something we could address would be hiding/showing the search bar when needed.

## User Y1 

### Basic Information

- Personal background: First year cornell Info Sci M.P.S. student from Nanchang, China.
  - he/him

### Notes

1.

- He noticed the nav bar and clicked on the search tab. He was then navigated to the search page.
- He typed "tomato" in the text box and hit the search button. 2 results appeared.
- He said "what if I made a typo", and tried to search "tomat". The same results appeared.
- He clicked on the tomato soup recipe, and was lead to the first recipe page.
- He tried to check some ingredients and asked: "will I be able to process to the next page if I don't check all the ingredients?" He tried and he was able to do so.
- He questioned: "What's the purpose of these checkboxes? Would it be better if you give a pop up window to the user?"
- He went to the first step page, and noticed the timer. It was not functioning, but I explained the expected functionality of the timer to him.
- He browsed the instruction, and clicked on the next button. He was navigated to step 2.
- When he was at step 2, he clicked the home button at the top left and was led to the home page. He was unable to go back to the step 2 page, which made him a little frustrated.
- He managed to go back by searching tomato and clicking on the same recipe again. He then clicked on the next button and went to the finishing page.
- He clicked on the large finish button and was guided back to the home page. However, he did challenge the necessity of the three buttons (finish, home, next) on the finishing page, since I explained that all of them lead to the home page.

2.

- He went straight to the search page again.
- He tried several keywords: "barbecue", "bbq" but got 0 result, so he was confused.
- He tried another one: "grill", and got the "grilled cheese".
- He told me that the recipe takes 15 minutes.
- He refreshed the search page and noticed the "cheese burger" before searching anything. He commented: "This recipe also seems suitable, but I didn't get it in the search result."

3.

- He went to the favorite page.
- He chose the two recipes with "cheese" in the title.

### Summary

Overall, this user completed the 3 tasks without substantial obstacles, but there exist some points which we could improve. First and foremost, we should get our timer working properly, since it is a crucial feature of our PWA. Then, regarding the recipe page, the user had some trouble navigate back to specific step page when he accidentally hit the home button. We might consider adding a return button in response. Besides, the user also stuck for a while when finishing the second task (pick a recipe for grilling barbecue) because the first few keywords didn't get any result. This could probably due to our inefficient task settings, or we could add a "label/theme" attribute to recipes and enable users to search/filter.

## User J1

### Basic Information

- Personal background: Third year Cornell AEM major, from NYC.
  - he/him

### Notes

1. You are a student who is planning to make dinner after your last class. You know you have tomatoes that are going to spoil and would like to make a meal with them, and you have enough time to cook something that would take longer than half an hour. Find a recipe and follow it step-by-step through to the end.

- Clicked search tab
- Browsed the recipe listings, said he liked spaghetti but it takes less than thirty minutes
- Said he didn't want to eat any of the options, proceeded to type "tomato" in search bar, pressed enter key but nothing happened, clicked search button
- Clicked on tomato soup as his only option, was brought to Tomato Soup recipe page
- Asked "Do I hit next?", I ask him "What do you think the checkboxes are for", explains how it serves a check for all ingredients being on hand
- Asks "What is cloves", I explain it means cloves of garlic, proceeds to check all checkboxes except for flour because does not want to put flour in tomato soup
- Hits next button, brought to Tomato Soup: Step 1 page
- Noices timer component, asks "Am I supposed to click this", clicks play button nothing happens, I explain the timer's expected functionality
- Clicks to Step 2 page
- Clicked home button, skipped Finish Recipe page

  2. You are a student with limited cooking skills who has a lot of time to make a longer recipe for a grilling barbecue with friends this weekend. You want to make sure that you have enough time, so you pick a recipe and note down how long the full cooking process would take.

- Clicked search tab
- Browsed All Recipes section
- Saw Cheese Burger recipe, clicked recipe card
- Saw blank page, clicked refresh button, was confused about nothing on screen
- Clicked back button
- Noticed times underneath recipe text, notes down "2 hours 5 min."

3.

- Sees suggested recipe mac and cheese
- Says he cooked it last night, his favorite food
- Clicked recipe card

### Summary

The user was able to complete the three tasks, but there were inefficiencies in his actions that we can capitalize on for improvement. First, some checkboxes on the recipe page should be
denoted as required for the user to advance to the next page. In regards to the timer component, it needs to better communicate to the user that it tracks the time it takes to
complete a step. In relation to the step pages, the final "Next" tab should be changed to display the text "Finish" to avoid users accidentally skipping it. The "Next" tabs should also be styled for better visibility. Beyond these main problems, we should fix some small typos.

2. You are a student with limited cooking skills who has a lot of time to make a longer recipe for a grilling barbecue with friends this weekend. You want to make sure that you have enough time, so you pick a recipe and note down how long the full cooking process would take.

- First clicked on the "Search" icon

- User went back to the "Favorites" icon 
- User was confused when the star icons were not filled in for each recipe on the "Favorites page 
- User identified the "grilled cheese" recipe as one of her beloved cheesy recipes  

### Summary

Overall, the user was able to successfully complete all three of the tasks. However, there were some suggestions for improvement. To begin, the user was confused about the "20:00" and "15:00" timer feature. In particular, the user felt that on the step 1 and step 2 pages of each recipe, it should explicitly say how much time each step of the cooking process takes. In addition, the user was confused when the star icons were not filled in for each recipe on the "Favorites" page. Specifically, the user felt that on the "Favorites" page, all of the recipes should have already been starred from the beginning.
